    "\n",
    "#### **Objective**\n",
    "The goal of this project is to predict the level of damage to buildings caused by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in Nepal based on various building and location features. The prediction target is an ordinal variable, `damage_grade`, which has three categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **1:** Low damage\n",
    "- **2:** Medium damage\n",
    "- **3:** Severe damage (almost complete destruction)\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurately predicting the level of damage will help local authorities, policymakers, and disaster response teams better allocate resources for post-disaster rebuilding efforts and preventive measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Key Questions to Answer**\n",
    "- What factors contribute most to earthquake-induced building damage?\n",
    "- Can a predictive model provide actionable insights to identify high-risk structures?\n",
    "- How can this model help inform disaster management strategies?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Success Criteria**\n",
    "The success of this project will be evaluated using the **micro-averaged F1 score**, which balances precision and recall across all damage grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "#### **Data Description**\n",
    "The dataset consists of information on buildings' structural features, geographic locations, and ownership statuses. Each row represents a specific building affected by the earthquake, with a total of 39 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Target Variable:** `damage_grade` (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "- **Key Features:**\n",
    "  - `geo_level_1_id`, `geo_level_2_id`, `geo_level_3_id`: Geographic identifiers at different administrative levels.\n",
    "  - `count_floors_pre_eq`: Number of floors before the earthquake.\n",
    "  - `age`: Age of the building in years.\n",
    "  - `area_percentage`: Normalized building footprint area.\n",
    "  - `height_percentage`: Normalized building height.\n",
    "  - `land_surface_condition`: Categorical variable for surface condition (`n`, `o`, `t`).\n",
    "  - `foundation_type`: Categorical variable for foundation type (`h`, `i`, `r`, `u`, `w`).\n",
    "  - `has_superstructure_*`: Binary flags indicating the material used for building superstructures (e.g., `has_superstructure_adobe_mud`, `has_superstructure_rc_engineered`).\n",
    "  - `legal_ownership_status`: Ownership status of the building (`a`, `r`, `v`, `w`).\n",
    "  - `count_families`: Number of families living in the building.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Data Characteristics**\n",
    "- **Categorical Variables:** Obfuscated random lowercase ASCII characters that do not imply semantic meaning.\n",
    "- **Binary Variables:** Indicate the presence of specific building features (e.g., superstructure types).\n",
    "- **Numerical Variables:** Include continuous and discrete values such as building age and count of floors.\n",
